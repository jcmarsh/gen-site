I forgot how to use org-mode!
Ah, there we go.
Okay, the idea is to write a few scripts that will automatically create my website for me.
It will follow a similar convention to that of my current site.
** Each top level folder will be a page
*** Top level pages will have a navigation bar to link to each other
*** Within their tab, sublinks will be provided for each sub page
*** Or anchor...?
** Content will be in a separate file
** Hmm.... git?
Oh right, fix my git commit attributions.
Makes sense: I don't get credit for forks unless it gets mainlined.
It's been git-ted!
